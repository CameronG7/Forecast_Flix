## Forecast_Flix

## Description

- Welcome!
- We have created a application using a wetaher and a movie api that not only gives you current weather data on the city you search, but also a movie recomendation based on that forecast.
- No longer will you have to bicker with a significant other or settle for a boring film as we provide from a variety of genres, but also high viewer ratings.
- Did you think something was more interesting to watch in a different city? No worries, just click back on your previous city searches to be taken back to that location.
